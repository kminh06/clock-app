# Multi-Functional Clock Application

This project is built using React. The goal of this project is to deliver a functional and serviceable app while learning the JS library React.

By building this project, I've:
- Learned the foundation of React (JSX, hooks, components, ...)
- Extended my skills in programming Web 1.0 applications
- Worked on bug-fixing and tackling complex problems
